# Day 1: Basic Logic

Welcome to your first Isabelle/HOL exercise!

## 📘 Goal
Practice writing simple lemmas involving logical connectives:
- `∧` (and)
- `∨` (or)
- `¬` (not)
- `⟹` (implies)

## 📍 Tasks
Open `BasicLogic.thy` in Isabelle and:
- Step through each lemma.
- Try replacing `auto` and `blast` with other proof steps (`apply`, `proof`, `qed`).
- Modify statements and see what breaks.

## 🧠 Tips
- Use `simp`, `auto`, `blast`, `rule`, or `apply` tactically.
- Use the Proof panel in Isabelle/jEdit to step through the proof.
